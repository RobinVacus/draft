# draft

This repository contains code that I use in my research. It is not linked to any article in particular.

## Packages

*pull_model* contains the core classes to simulate gossip-like dynamics.
*tests* contains the definition of some behaviors, and is used to launch simulations.
*export* contains the code that prints the results of the simulations to a file. I use xml_reader.py (Python 3) to read this file and plot the results.
